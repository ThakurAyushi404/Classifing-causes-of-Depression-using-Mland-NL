# Classifying Causes of Depression using ML and NLP 🧠💬

This repository supports my Master's thesis project focused on **identifying specific causes of depression** (like domestic violence, stress, and gender inequality) using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques applied to social media data.

## 📚 Project Overview

- The goal is to **classify causes of depression** from real-world tweets using supervised machine learning.
- I have applied **text preprocessing, lemmatization, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings**, and **ML models like SVM and XGBoost** for classification.
- This work aims to support **mental health professionals** by identifying key depression-related patterns and causes through social data.

## 🧪 Repository Structure

- `Classification_Model.ipynb`  
  👉 Contains preprocessing, modeling, classification, evaluation, and visual results with summaries.

- `Merged_Dataset_and_Summary.ipynb`  
  👉 Shows merged annotated datasets and high-level findings.

## 📎 Proposal

The original **thesis proposal** is attached in this repository.  
⚠️ **Note:** The final research paper is currently under review and will be published soon.

## 📩 Get in Touch
