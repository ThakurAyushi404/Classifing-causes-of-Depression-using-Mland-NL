# Classifying Causes of Depression using ML and NLP 🧠💬

This repository presents the research work conducted as part of my Master's thesis, focused on **classifying the causes of depression**—such as **domestic violence, stress, and gender inequality**—from social media tweets using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

## 📚 Project Summary

The study involves:
- Extracting lexicons and patterns using **TF-IDF** and rule-based methods
- Training and evaluating **classification models** such as **XGBoost** and **SVM**
- Applying **SMOTE** to address class imbalance
- Visualizing results to understand depression triggers

This research aims to contribute toward early detection and categorization of depression causes through language analysis.
